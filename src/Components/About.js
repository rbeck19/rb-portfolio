				I am a Full-stack developer with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Criminal Justice and possess a strong interest 
				in React and Javascript. As a former NYPD police officer for five years, I gained skills in problem-solving, 
				being resourceful in high stress situations, and empathetically resolving the situations at hand. Along with 
				this I collaborated with different units and precincts. 
				</p>
				<p className='aboutPrgh'>
				I use those same strengths when programming. Whether it 
				is a bug in my application, collaborating with other team members to get a project completed, or when helping a 
				fellow peer debug. I have a unique ability to approach a problem from an outsider perspective. My past experiences 
				will allow me to foster an environment that prioritizes patience, empathy, and collaboration in order to be a great 
				teammate and programmer.
